                <p>Many Low Voltage power circuit breakers have older trip units that often require replacement or
                    upgrade. Midwest Switchgear can retrofit these trip units with new trip devices that offer pre-trip
                    data, metering information, and communications. This data can be beneficial for trouble- shooting,
                    maintenance, and planning purposes.</p>
