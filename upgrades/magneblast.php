                <h3>We stock new bearing and bushing kits</h3>
                <p>Many of the MK 13 operating mechanisms were made with fiber bushings that we upgrade with an oil-impregnated bronze bushing.</p>

                <h3>Primary Disconnect Bottle Solution:</h3>
                <p>The pitch material found in the primary disconnect bottles may leak onto the circuit breaker primary disconnect bushings. This can lead to insulation degradation and a Switchgear can “RE-PITCH” the primary disconnect bottles using a silicon-based material. This work can be done with the bottles still mounted in the switchgear. During this process, we will inspect your bus and re-insulate if necessary.</p>

                <h3>Elevator/Racking Mechanism Solution:</h3>
                <p>Midwest Switchgear has created a replacement part kit that includes all bearings, bushings, gears, sprockets, shafts, and pins for both the left-hand and right-hand sides of the elevator/racking mechanism. These kits are kept in stock for immediate delivery and Midwest Swichgear technicians are available for emergency installation or scheduled repairs.</p>
